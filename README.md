## Overview of the Framework

1. **Diagesis**: The represented world within the film, including characters, settings, and events.
2. **Acts**: The major structural divisions of the narrative.
3. **Beats**: Specific moments or events within acts that advance the story.
4. **Syntagmas**: Types of sequences or relationships between shots, based on film semiotics.
5. **Shots**: Individual camera shots, crafted using cinematic techniques.

## Framework Structure

### **1. Diagesis**

- **Definition**: The narrative world where the story unfolds, encompassing characters, settings, and events.
- **Application**: Define the overarching story elements that will be explored throughout the film.

### **2. Acts**

- **Definition**: The primary divisions of the narrative structure (e.g., Act One: Setup, Act Two: Confrontation, Act Three: Resolution).
- **Application**: Use the **Save the Cat Beat Sheet** to break down the story into three acts, each containing specific beats.

### **3. Beats**

- **Definition**: Key moments within acts that drive the narrative forward.
- **Application**: Utilize the 15-beat structure from the **Save the Cat Beat Sheet** for detailed pacing and character development.

### **4. Syntagmas**

- **Definition**: The arrangement of sequences and their relationships in film, based on Christian Metz's film semiotics.
- **Types of Syntagmas**:
    - **Autonomous Shot**
    - **Parallel Syntagma**
    - **Bracket Syntagma**
    - **Descriptive Syntagma**
    - **Alternate Syntagma**
    - **Scene**
    - **Episodic Sequence**
    - **Ordinary Sequence**
- **Application**: Select the appropriate syntagma type to structure each beat, enhancing the storytelling through cinematic language.

### **5. Shots**

- **Definition**: The visual representation of scenes, crafted using camera techniques and movements.
- **Tools**:
    - **Cybernetic Cineosis**: Provides seven types of images (e.g., Perception-Image, Action-Image) for conceptualizing shots.
    - **CinePrompt**: Structures and orders the prompt images using detailed descriptors.
- **Application**: Design each shot by choosing the image type and crafting prompts that include camera movement, scene establishment, and additional details.

## Utilizing Cybernetic Cineosis and CinePrompt

### **Cybernetic Cineosis**: Seven Types of Images

1. **Perception-Image**: Focus on what the character perceives.
2. **Action-Image**: Depict the character's actions.
3. **Affection-Image**: Highlight the character's emotions.
4. **Opsigns**: Emphasize optical aspects, creating contemplative visuals.
5. **Sonsigns**: Focus on auditory elements.
6. **Crystal-Image**: Merge multiple layers of time or reality.
7. **Recollection-Image**: Portray memories or reflections.

### **CinePrompt**: Structuring the Shot

- **Camera Movement**: Define how the camera moves to capture the shot.
- **Establishing Scene**: Describe the initial setting and context.
- **Additional Details**: Include elements that enhance the visual storytelling.

**Example CinePrompt for the Finale**:

- **Camera Movement**: The camera performs a slow, circular dolly around the protagonist, capturing their surroundings.
- **Establishing Scene**: The scene starts with the protagonist standing alone in the empty gallery before guests arrive.
- **Additional Details**: The lighting gradually brightens as people enter, symbolizing the protagonist's emerging recognition.

## Integrating Syntagmas

Select the syntagma that best fits the narrative moment:

- **Descriptive Syntagma**: For establishing settings or montages.
- **Scene**: For dialogues or interactions in a continuous time and space.
- **Episodic Sequence**: For showing progression over time.
- **Alternate Syntagma**: For intercutting parallel actions or themes.

## Building the Matrix-Editor

Create a spreadsheet or table with the following columns:

1. **Diagesis** (Who, Where, What)
2. **Act**
3. **Beat**
4. **Syntagma** (Sequence Type)
5. **Cybernetic Cineosis Image Type**
6. **CinePrompt Details**

Fill in each row corresponding to the beats of your story, ensuring that each element is thoughtfully considered and contributes to the overall narrative.

## Conclusion

This integrated framework allows for a comprehensive approach to film storytelling by:

- **Aligning Narrative and Cinematic Techniques**: Ensuring that the story's content and its visual presentation are harmoniously connected.
- **Enhancing Storytelling Depth**: Utilizing semiotics and cinematic language to add layers of meaning.
- **Streamlining the Creative Process**: Providing a structured method for developing each aspect of the film, from broad narrative strokes to specific shot compositions.

By following this matrix-editor, you can craft a film that is not only narratively compelling but also rich in cinematic expression, engaging audiences on multiple levels.
